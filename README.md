## ðŸ“œ About Project

> 42 School Philosophers project designed around Edsger Dijkstra's famous [dining philosophers problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dining_philosophers_problem) and [medium.com](https://medium.com/@ruinadd/philosophers-42-guide-the-dining-philosophers-problem-893a24bc0fe2). \
> For this project, we must learn about concurrent programming and shared memory synconization.

For detailed information, refer to the [**subject of this project**].

	ðŸš€ TLDR: This project is an introduction to the basics of multithreading and multiprocessing.
    	 Work on the same memory space, learn about mutexes, semaphores, and shared memory.

> [!NOTE]  
> Because of 42 School norm requirements:
> * Each function can't have more than 25 lines of code.
> * All variables are declared and aligned at the top of each function.
> * Project should be created just with allowed functions otherwise it's cheating.

## ðŸ”· Mandatory Part

#### The subject describes the problem as follows:

* One or more philosophers sit at a round table.
* There is a large bowl of spaghetti in the middle of the table.
* The spaghetti can only be eaten with two forks.
* There are only as many forks as there are philosophers.
* Each philosopher successively eats, sleeps and thinks.
* If a philosopher hasn't eaten in a certain timeframe, he will die of starvation.
* Philosophers cannot communicate with each other.

#### The program takes the following arguments:

`./philo <number_of_philosophers> <time_to_die> <time_to_eat> <time_to_sleep>
[number_of_times_each_philosopher_must_eat]`

* **```number_of_philosophers```**: the number of philosophers around the table.
* **```time_to_die```**: a number representing the time in milliseconds a philosopher has to live after a meal. If a philosopher hasnâ€™t started eating time_to_die milliseconds after the beginning of his last meal or the beginning of the simulation, he will die.
* **```time_to_eat```**: a number representing the time in milliseconds a philosopher takes to finish his meal. During that time, the philosopher keeps his two forks in hand.
* **```time_to_sleep```**: the time in milliseconds that a philosopher spends sleeping.
* **```number_of_times_each_philosopher_must_eat```**: an optional argument that allows the program to stop if all the philosophers have eaten at least that many times. If this argument is not specified, the simulation carries on unless a philosopher dies.

#### Program logs philosophers actions in this format. X is philosopher ID:

```
timestamp_in_ms X has taken a fork
timestamp_in_ms X is eating
timestamp_in_ms X is sleeping
timestamp_in_ms X is thinking
timestamp_in_ms X died
```

## Mandatory Part - Threads and Mutexes

In the mandatory part, each philosopher is a thread and each fork is protected by a mutex. There is exactly one fork between each philosopher and a philosopher must take the forks to his immediate left and right in order to eat.

### Usage

Git clone the project and for the mandatory part:

To compile, use ```make```:

```shell
make
```

Run the program with the following arguments:

```shell
./philo <number_of_philosophers> <time_to_die> <time_to_eat> <time_to_sleep> [number_of_times_each_philo_must_eat]
```

The arguments must be integers between 0 and INT_MAX representing a time in milliseconds. For example:

```shell
/philo 4 800 200 200 5
```

If the arguments are valid, the program will output the actions of each philosopher until one of them dies or until all of them have eaten number_of_times_each_philo_must_eat, if specified.
